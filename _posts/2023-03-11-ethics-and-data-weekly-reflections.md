## Introduction
In the next 6 weeks, I will be writing about relevant topics pertaining to ethics in data. Being a software developer, AI and ML practitioner, I need to exert more effort to understand the ethical implications of the industry that I belong to and the work that I do.

## Week 1: Code Completion Tooling

In June 2021, [GitHub released Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot), a code completion tool that uses machine learning to write code for you. Marketed as an **AI Pair Programmer**, it's intended to help developers write code faster. Copilot has been trained on billions of lines of code from various sources, including public Open Source projects in GitHub and other public repositories.

Nearly a year to the date, Amazon released a preview of **[Amazon Code Whisperer](https://aws.amazon.com/codewhisperer/)**, a similar tool to Copilot.  

As a software developer, I am excited about the possibilities of these tools. I am always on the lookout for tools that can help me write better code. As awesome as these tools are, I am also concerned about their ethical implications. Being trained on [Open Source code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source), what will this mean to the source code that it has generated?

From the point of view of [GitHub](https://github.com/) and [Amazon](https://aws.amazon.com/), it makes great business sense, as it uses open source code freely available on the web. It's akin to a Mining company that mines and exploits resources for free, then selling it for a huge profit. 

I am almost certain that the original authors did not intend their code to be used in this manner. There is a [class action](https://githubcopilotlitigation.com/) filed against Copilot on behalf of the millions of GitHub users whose code was used to train the tool. The outcome of this litigation could have significant implications for the these **products**, the millions of **developers** already using them, and the source code **authors**.
