## Not Hotdog App

I still remember the moment that piqued my interest in Data Science. It was probably a couple of years or so ago, I saw this segment in a popular [HBO sitcom - Silicon Valley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon_Valley_(TV_series)){:target="_blank"}, and I wasn't even following the series. I don't remember, but for some reason I found myself watching [this on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqTntG1RXSY){:target="_blank"}. So hilarious when Jian Yang first demoed the Not Hotdog app. But when I discovered that it was actually a real app that they developed for the series, I couldn't resist, but I had to find out exactly [how they made it](https://medium.com/@timanglade/how-hbos-silicon-valley-built-not-hotdog-with-mobile-tensorflow-keras-react-native-ef03260747f3){:target="_blank"}.

## Week 3 - More Pandas

This week, we spent more time getting deeper experience with Pandas, how data scientists use it to slice and dice data and effectively use it for exploratory data analysis. As we get to use it more, we get the appreciation of how indespensible it is at this stage of this data science end to end process. And one can undestand why data scientists love using Jupyter notebooks at this stage in the process too. 

The course instructor always talks about that in data science, one needs to build this **intuition**, of being able to find a problem that is worth solving where it's solution has an impact as well as identify if the data we have available is of good quality. And that we can have all the volume of data we want, and if it is no good, then they still belong in the rubbish bin. My goal, by the end of this course, is to not only complete the Capstone project, but more importantly, to be able to understand at least how to achieve that intuition that he keeps on talking about.
