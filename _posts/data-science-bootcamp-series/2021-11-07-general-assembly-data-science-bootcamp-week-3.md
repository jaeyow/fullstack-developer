## Week 3 - More Pandas

I still remember the moment that piqued my interest in subject of Data Science. It was probably a couple of years or so ago, I saw this segment in a popular [HBO sitcom - Silicon Valley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon_Valley_(TV_series)){:target="_blank"}, and I wasn't even following the series. I don't remember, but for some reason I found myself watching [this on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqTntG1RXSY){:target="_blank"}. So hilarious when Jian Yang first demoed the Hotdog - Not Hotdog app. It was funny, but when I discovered that it was actually a real app that they developed for the series, I couldn't resist, but I had to find out exactly [how they made it](https://medium.com/@timanglade/how-hbos-silicon-valley-built-not-hotdog-with-mobile-tensorflow-keras-react-native-ef03260747f3){:target="_blank"}. 

This week, we spent more time getting deeper experience with Pandas, how data scientists use it to slice and dice data and effectively use it for exploratory data analysis. As we get to use it more, we get the appreciation of how indespensible it is at this stage of this end to end process. And one can undestand why data scientists love using Jupyter notebooks at this stage in the process. 

The course instructor always talks about that in data science, one needs to build this **intuition**, of being able to identify if the data we have available is good quality. And that we can have all the volume of data we want, and if it is no good, then they still belong in the rubbish bin. My goal, by the end of this course, is to not only complete the Capstone project, but more importantly, I want to be able to understand at least how to achieve that intuition that he keeps on talking about.

## Unit Project due after this weekend

GA's 10-week course is organized into 4 units. And this week is the end of Unit 1, and that it means that the cohort will have to work and submit the first Unit project.

As I am in between jobs at the moment, I have lots of time in my hands, believe me I have already spent hours this week keeping myself up to date with my favorite streaming shows in Netflix, Amazon, and Apple TV! More importantly, I have also spent some quality time to work on and complete the current Unit Project.

The Unit Project is a 4 problem Python Coding exercise, nothing complicated, however, they are not that trivial either. One will need some quality time to focus and get lots of practice to really have the confidence level required as the course progresses. This is the best chance to devote time to learn about the language, because from next week, it can get really fast and complicated, and I want the language issues out of the way by then.

## Ooh, the Capstone Project...

The Final Project is the thing that gives me the most excitement in this course. I know it is difficult, specially for something one has not done before, but I am so looking forward to going all in and giving it all I've got. Bear in mind that this is still a part-time course, and the other aspects of my family life, work, physical fitness, etc, etc, are still there and need slice of my time. So it will be interesting, but I'm pumped and ready. 

This early, we have been made aware that the **Capstone Project proposal** will be due by the end of Unit 2, and that we better start thinking about what real-world problems we want to solve. Something we are really into and familiar with, since working with something otherwise will make it more difficult than it really is. The course instructor and the instructor associate are there to help us choose an appropriately-scoped project that can be completed in the short 10 week period. 

We will really need guidance at this stage, since being data science novices, we still do not have the **intuition** in identifying what class/scope of problems are possible to be solved in this 10-week window. 

There are countless Final Project possibilities, based on the readily available dataset, for example:

- Amazon Pricing Data
- Health Insurance Marketplace
- Instacart Orders
- Consumer Loan Data
- Fuel Economy Data
- Craft Beers Data
- All Trump Tweets
- Choose your own dataset

I will likely choose my own dataset that are more in line with my interests.
