## Conclusion

We covered a bit of ground with our DynamoDB learnings in this article. DynamoDB plays a very important role inside Amazon where they have migrated hundreds of mission critical and thousands of secondary services.

However, it still gets mixed reviews from the developer community. It is important to understand that in adopting a new technology like DynamoDB, one should learn how to use it the correct way before applying it in production.

Developers who are experts in RDBMS technology by default apply that same method to DynamoDB, but that just does not work. They find that as they scale, their application becomes slower and slower, or more expensive to run, or both.

We were introduced to the single-table method - the recommended (yet lesser known) way to model data in DynamoDB. DynamoDB promises single-digit millisecond latency, however to achieve this, one should be ready to accept the compromises.

If DynamoDB is good enough for Amazon, it's good enough for me too.
