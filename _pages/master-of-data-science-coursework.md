I am currently pursuing my [Master of Data Science from the University of New South Wales](https://studyonline.unsw.edu.au/online-programs/master-data-science). The program, which began on January 2023, consists of 15 courses, including 3 prerequisites, and concludes with a Capstone Project.

The coursework is fully online and utilizes the well-known learning platform, [Moodle](https://moodle.org/), to facilitate the learning experience. The program is designed as Hexamesters, where students take one course per term, with six teaching terms per year. If I am able to attend every teaching term, I anticipate completing the program in just over two years.

## Course 1 - Database Systems

I've copied the course introductions straight from the course materials. At the end of the post, I have shared my thoughts on the it.

**Week 1: Data models and database design**

This week you will be introduced to data and databases. You will learn how to systematically analyse the data requirements of a database to construct an ER (Entity-Relationship) model and present it as an ER diagram. Finally, you will practise a series of activities to apply your knowledge.

**Week 2: Relational data model and ER mapping**

This week you will learn the foundations for implementing well-constrained relational database models and how to map the Entity-Relationship (ER) data model with the relational data model. You will understand the relational data model, the types of constraints associated with it and how the relational data model differs from the ER model. You will also practise a series of activities to apply your knowledge.

**Week 3: SQL**

This week, you will learn Structured Query Language (SQL). SQL consists of a data definition language, data manipulation language and a data control language. You will create a database, performing various types of data manipulation and data administration, and query the database to extract useful information using SQL commands.

Firstly, you will cover relational algebra, which provides a theoretical foundation for relational databases and SQL. Then you will learn SQL commands, aggregation and grouping to create databases. You will also learn how to write complex SQL queries. Finally, you will practise a series of activities to apply your knowledge.

**Week 4: Advanced SQL and Schemas**

Last week you learnt and practised SQL which is a very powerful language for extracting data from the database. While it's powerful, it can't do everything, and there are occasions where you need additional programming to extract data to handle more complex tasks. Postgres allows user-defined functions, known as stored procedures. Such functions can be written in many languages like SQL, PLpgSQL, C, Python, etc. You will learn how to define stored procedures and triggers in PLpgSQL. You will identify the purpose or the various scenarios where you can use triggers. This will substantially increase in the capability to program a database.

**Week 5: Database schema analysis, normalisation**

This week you will look at the notion of relational data models. You will determine whether a particular relational data model is good. Relational design theory deals with the relationship between attributes. How these attributes are related to each other? A functional dependency is a constraint that describes the relationship between attributes in a relation. You will analyse the functional dependencies in relational database schemas and identify the redundancy problems. Further you will apply various normalisation techniques to reduce or remove the data redundancy in these schemas. Finally, you will practise a series of activities to apply your knowledge.

**Week 6: Transactions, security and architectures**

This week you will be introduced to SQL performance tuning. You will learn how to identify when your queries can be improved and what are the ways to improve them. You will cover transaction processing and the respective control commands. A transaction is the propagation of changes to the database. If you are creating, updating or deleting a record from a table then you are performing a transaction. to control these transactions to ensure data integrity and to handle database errors. These transactions can be controlled using commands to ensure data integrity and to handle database errors. You will also learn about the database security issues and the range of security controls to protect the database. Finally, you will practise a series of activities to apply your knowledge. 

### My comments

The title of the course is a disappointment. Although the title says database systems, it is really a course on SQL. What I like about this is that it is designed to be taken as a full online learning experience. The course is structured in a way that allows students to learn at their own pace. 

Although I have been using SQL in many of my past projects, I have never taken a course on it. I am glad that I am taking this course because it has helped me to understand the fundamentals of SQL and how to use it to solve real-world problems. I have also learned how to use the Postgres database and how to use the PLpgSQL language to write stored procedures and triggers. Whats great was the time spent in learning the basics of ER Diagrams, it seems easy, it is easy, however I never really spent too much time understanding it really well. I am glad that I have and now I feel that I have a better understanding of how to design a database.

Also I felt that the course was a bit dated. I have worked with databases for many years and there are many things we do on a regular basis, like analysing slow queries, maintaining databases like approaches to backups, schema and data migration, interfacing with web and mobile applications, and issues that you would encounter in a day to day life of working with databases. Well, the course is only 6 weeks after all, a focused 6 weeks at that. Not sure how to fit all that in that time. 

All in all I would rate the course a 6/10. I did enjoy getting very familiar with SQl and I'm happy with that. I would have liked to see more on database design and maintenance. I would have also liked to see more on the use of SQL in the context of data science.
