I am currently pursuing my [Master of Data Science from the University of New South Wales](https://studyonline.unsw.edu.au/online-programs/master-data-science). The program, which began on January 2023, consists of 15 courses, including 3 prerequisites, and concludes with a Capstone Project.

The coursework is fully online and utilizes the well-known learning platform, [Moodle](https://moodle.org/), to facilitate the learning experience. The program is designed as Hexamesters, where students take one course per term, with six teaching terms per year. If I am able to attend every teaching term, I anticipate completing the program in just over two years.

## Course 1 - Database Systems

I've copied the course introductions straight from the course materials. At the end of the post, I have shared my thoughts on the it.

**Week 1: Data models and database design**

This week you will be introduced to data and databases. You will learn how to systematically analyse the data requirements of a database to construct an ER (Entity-Relationship) model and present it as an ER diagram. Finally, you will practise a series of activities to apply your knowledge.

**Week 2: Relational data model and ER mapping**

This week you will learn the foundations for implementing well-constrained relational database models and how to map the Entity-Relationship (ER) data model with the relational data model. You will understand the relational data model, the types of constraints associated with it and how the relational data model differs from the ER model. You will also practise a series of activities to apply your knowledge.

**Week 3: SQL**

This week, you will learn Structured Query Language (SQL). SQL consists of a data definition language, data manipulation language and a data control language. You will create a database, performing various types of data manipulation and data administration, and query the database to extract useful information using SQL commands.

Firstly, you will cover relational algebra, which provides a theoretical foundation for relational databases and SQL. Then you will learn SQL commands, aggregation and grouping to create databases. You will also learn how to write complex SQL queries. Finally, you will practise a series of activities to apply your knowledge.

**Week 4: Advanced SQL and Schemas**

Last week you learnt and practised SQL which is a very powerful language for extracting data from the database. While it's powerful, it can't do everything, and there are occasions where you need additional programming to extract data to handle more complex tasks. Postgres allows user-defined functions, known as stored procedures. Such functions can be written in many languages like SQL, PLpgSQL, C, Python, etc. You will learn how to define stored procedures and triggers in PLpgSQL. You will identify the purpose or the various scenarios where you can use triggers. This will substantially increase in the capability to program a database.

**Week 5: Database schema analysis, normalisation**

This week you will look at the notion of relational data models. You will determine whether a particular relational data model is good. Relational design theory deals with the relationship between attributes. How these attributes are related to each other? A functional dependency is a constraint that describes the relationship between attributes in a relation. You will analyse the functional dependencies in relational database schemas and identify the redundancy problems. Further you will apply various normalisation techniques to reduce or remove the data redundancy in these schemas. Finally, you will practise a series of activities to apply your knowledge.

**Week 6: Transactions, security and architectures**

This week you will be introduced to SQL performance tuning. You will learn how to identify when your queries can be improved and what are the ways to improve them. You will cover transaction processing and the respective control commands. A transaction is the propagation of changes to the database. If you are creating, updating or deleting a record from a table then you are performing a transaction. to control these transactions to ensure data integrity and to handle database errors. These transactions can be controlled using commands to ensure data integrity and to handle database errors. You will also learn about the database security issues and the range of security controls to protect the database. Finally, you will practise a series of activities to apply your knowledge. 

### My comments

The course I took on database systems was titled as such, but was primarily focused on teaching SQL. Despite the discrepancy between the course title and content, I found the course to be a worthwhile online learning experience, as it allowed for flexible self-paced learning.

While I had previously used SQL in various projects, this course provided me with a solid foundation in the fundamentals of SQL and its practical applications for solving real-world problems. In addition, the course also covered the use of the Postgres database and the PLpgSQL language for writing stored procedures and triggers. I particularly appreciated the time spent on learning ER Diagrams, which was an area I had not fully grasped before, but now feel more confident in designing databases.

One area where the course fell short was its outdated approach. As someone who has worked with databases for many years, I expected to see topics such as analyzing slow queries, database maintenance, backups, schema, and data migration, interfacing with web and mobile applications, and dealing with day-to-day issues that are commonly encountered while working with databases. However, given the course's duration of only 6 weeks, I understand that it would have been challenging to cover all these areas in-depth.

Overall, I would rate the course a **6 out of 10**. While I appreciated the comprehensive coverage of SQL, I would have preferred to see more focus on database design and maintenance. Additionally, incorporating more material on the use of SQL in data science would have made the course more relevant for current trends.
