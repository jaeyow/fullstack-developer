### Formula 1 Race Prediction

Capstone project for the 3 month [General Assembly Data Science Bootcamp](https://generalassemb.ly/education/data-science-immersive/sydney) where we work on a Data Science problem and go through a process to achieve the desired outcome of being able to predict the outcome of a Formula 1 race.

Data Science processes such as Exploratory Data Analysis, Feature Engineering, Regression Approaches, Classification Approaches, Feature Importance, Feature Selection, Models Comparison, and Model Selection. 

Also went through [MLOps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MLOps) using an unlikely tool in Github Actions - in this case where only the basics are required, it was enough (barely!).
