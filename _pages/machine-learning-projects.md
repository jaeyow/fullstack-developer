This space is for my projects that are related to Data Science and Machine Learning.

### Formula 1 Race Prediction

My capstone project for the 3 month [General Assembly Data Science Bootcamp](https://generalassemb.ly/education/data-science-immersive/sydney) where we work on a Data Science problem and go through a process to achieve the desired outcome of being able to predict the winner of a Formula 1 race.

Data Science processes such as Exploratory Data Analysis, Feature Engineering, Regression Approaches, Classification Approaches, Feature Importance, Feature Selection, Models Comparison, and Model Selection. 

Also went through [MLOps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MLOps) using an unlikely tool in Github Actions - in this case where only the basics are required, it was enough (barely!).

### Image Classification for the MNIST Dataset
In this project, we tackle the MNIST dataset using [Amazon SageMaker's](https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/) Linear Learner algorithm. We will use [Metaflow](https://metaflow.org/) to orchestrate the training and deployment of the model. We will also use [Github Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) to automate the process of training and deploying the model.

### AutoML with Amazon Rekognition

This project is to explore the use of Amazon Rekognition for image classification. Amazon Rekognition is a high level AI service that allows you to perform image classification, object detection, face detection, face recognition, and text detection. I have created an end-to-end application using [AWS Amplify](https://aws.amazon.com/amplify/), [Amazon Rekognition](https://aws.amazon.com/rekognition/), and Amazon S3. This was to play around with the capabilities of this AutoML service.
